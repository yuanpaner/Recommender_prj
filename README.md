# Recommender_prj
I'm working on organizing the project again.

# Note
If you want to run the program on your own computer, some folders with files, which can be downloaded from websites are needed:
```shell
--ml-latest-small  
    --ratings.csv // data files
--ml-20m
    --ratings.csv
--DumpFiles // used to dump algorithm to avoid repeated train
```
